Wordpress Plugin
==

**This plugin is a work in progress**.

This plugin will give you everything you need to turn your Wordpress install into a full fledged silent auction, fund raising machine!


## Setup
Install the plugin, you will then see a Handbid option in the admin area on the left sidebar. In here is where you can insert your Consumer Key / Consumer Secret
as well as specify the Rest API Url ( defaults to https://rest.handbid.com ). After you put in your values you can then save the changes and test your rest endpoint credentials to ensure that it is configured properly.
